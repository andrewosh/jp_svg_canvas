# jp_svg_canvas

A very simple SVG canvas proxy widget for Jupyter visualizations.

The widget permits Python code to 

- Create of SVG canvases on Jupyter *.ipynb notebooks.
- Add SVG objects to the canvas.
- Modify existing objects on the canvas by name.
- Delete named objects from the canvas.
- Respond to mouse events in the canvas.

pip install ipython --upgrade
pip install ipywidgets --upgrade
